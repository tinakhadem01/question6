# Is it rude to recline your seat on an airplane?
**I chose the question above because I relate to it personally. It’s something I ask myself every time I get on a plane, so it naturally piqued my curiosity. I found it very interesting that over half of the respondents thought it is not rude to recline your seat. Before looking at and graphing the data, I had hypothesized that fewer than 40% of respondents would think it wasn’t rude. Digging deeper into the dataset, I looked specifically at respondents who have children under 18 years old. I found that 33% of them said reclining is rude or somewhat rude, while 67% said it’s not rude at all. This makes me think that those with kids may be more focused on caring for them and therefore less likely to view seat reclining as an issue. This observation is visualized in a seperate bar chart included above and I have attached the data for it in the files. Overall, this dataset was really interesting and posed a lot of intriguing questions.**
